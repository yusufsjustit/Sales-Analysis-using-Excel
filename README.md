# 📊 Sales Dataset Analysis (Excel)

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize sales data using **Microsoft Excel**. The dataset contains sales transactions, and I used a range of Excel features to perform calculations, build summaries, and create interactive reports.  

The objective of this project was to show how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights that support decision-making.

### 2️⃣ Functions & Formulas
- ➕ **Basic functions**: `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT` for quick summaries.  
- 🎯 **Conditional functions**:  
  - 📌 `SUMIF` & `SUMIFS` – calculated sales totals by region, product, and date range.  
  - 📊 `AVERAGEIF` & `AVERAGEIFS` – found average order values under specific conditions.  
- 🧮 **User-defined formulas**: created custom calculations to support unique business rules.  
- 🎨 **Conditional Formatting**: highlighted sales trends, top/bottom performers, and outliers for easy interpretation.

### 3️⃣ Pivot Tables & Interactive Dashboards
- 📈 Built **Pivot Tables** to analyze sales by product category, region, and customer segment.  
- 📊 Created **Pivot Charts** to visualize key KPIs (revenue trends, top products, regional performance).  
- 🖱️ Used **Slicers** for interactive filtering, allowing end-users to drill down into the data with a single click.
